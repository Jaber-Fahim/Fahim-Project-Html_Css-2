            <h2>Masrafee Bin Mortaza</h2>
            <h3>The Best Captain</h3>
            <p>Mashrafe Bin Mortaza (Bengali: মাশরাফি বিন মর্তুজা About this soundpronunciation  (help·info); born 5 October 1983) is a Bangladeshi international cricketer and politician who is the current captain of the One Day Internationals for the Bangladesh national cricket team and member of the parliament Jatiya Sangsad from Narail-2. He was ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN “WORLD FAME 100” in 2019.[6][7] He also captained Bangladesh in Twenty20 Internationals. He broke into the national side in late 2001 against Zimbabwe and represented Bangladesh before having played a single first-class match. Mortaza captained his country in one Test and seven One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2009 and 2010, however injury meant he was in and out of the side and Shakib Al Hasan was appointed captain in Mortaza's absence. Mortaza used to be considered one of the fastest bowlers produced by Bangladesh, previously bowling in the mid-135s-145s km/h in the 2000s,[8] and regularly opens the bowling. He is a useful lower-middle order batsman, with a first-class century and three Test half centuries to his name. Mortaza's career has been hampered by fifteen injuries and he has undergone a total of ten operations on his knees and ankles.[9]</p>

        <h2>Virat Kholi</h2>
        <h3>The Best Captain</h3>
        <p>Virat Kohli (About this soundpronunciation (help·info); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian cricketer who currently captains the India national team. A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world.[3] He plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and has been the team's captain since 2013. Since October 2017, he has been the top-ranked ODI batsman in the world and is currently 1st in Test rankings with 928 points.[4][5] Among Indian batsmen, Kohli has the best ever Test rating (937 points), ODI rating (911 points) and T20I rating (897 points).

            Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After a few months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa.[6] Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013,[7] Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016).</p>
